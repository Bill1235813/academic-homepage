I am currently a 4-th year Ph.D. candidate at University of Southern California, co-advised by 
<a href="https://robinjia.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Robin Jia</a> and 
<a href="https://jessethomason.com/" target="_blank">Prof. Jesse Thomason</a>.
My research interests mainly focus on natural language processing and neuro-symbolic methods.
Previously, I worked with 
<a href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~feisha/" target="_blank">Prof. Fei Sha</a> 
on vision-language navigation and language pretrained models.


I finished my bachelor of computer science at Simon Fraser University and Zhejiang University through a Dual Degree Program. 
During my undergraduate time, I worked with 
<a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~mori/" target="_blank">Prof. Greg Mori</a> and 
<a href="https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~oschulte/" target="_blank">Prof. Oliver Schulte</a> 
on robotics and reinforcement learning.

Here is my latest <a href="https://billzhu.me/files/Bill_CV.pdf" target="_blank">Curriculum Vitae</a>.
